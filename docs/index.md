## What is AutoPwnGPT?

AutoPwnGPT is a next-generation offensive security tool that combines a modular penetration testing framework with a GPT-powered natural language interface. It enables security professionals to conduct comprehensive security assessments using natural language commands, which are automatically translated into technical operations executed by specialized modules.

## Key Concepts

- **Natural Language Interface**: The system translates English commands into technical operations
- **Modular Architecture**: Tasks are executed by specialized modules for different security testing functions
- **Contextual Memory**: The system maintains state between commands, allowing for complex operations 
- **Workflow Engine**: Enables chaining of security testing steps in logical sequences

## Getting Started

If you're new to AutoPwnGPT, we recommend starting with the [Installation Guide](installation.md) followed by the [User Guide](user_guide/index.md).
